# RSE_survey_longitudinal
This repository is used to store data from international surveys conducted by the Software Sustainability Institute.

We ran the first survey in 2016, which provided an insight into the demographics, job satisfaction, and practices of research software engineers (RSEs) in the UK. To support and broaden this work, the institute will conduct the survey at regular intervals and extend the geographical coverage to facilitate inter-country comparisons. The results of the surveys, anonymised and open licensed, will act as a a valuable resource to understand and improve the working conditions for RSEs.

In 2017 we also surveyed Canadian RSEs and we added four countries, Germany, Netherlands, South Africa and USA. Our thanks to our partners: Scott Henwood (Canada), Stephan Janosch and Martin Hammitzsch (Germany), Ben van Werkhoven and Tom Bakker (Netherlands), Anelda van der Walt (South Africa) and Daniel Katz and Sandra Gesing (USA).

Since 2018 we have worked differently and created a survey for all countries (rather than one survey for each one).

This site covers results from all surveys since 2016.
